1.0.572
-------

* [Hack] Include two more frames in zone view in order to compensate for delayed GPU frames

1.0.571
-------

* Reworked send/receive buffers.

1.0.570
-------

* Fixed a bug where Send and Receive would not transmit the whole buffer. 
* [PS4][Fix] Fixed a bug where sockets would not be opened properly.

1.0.569
-------

* Session view now displays a list of servers. The default server is now stored in the user's registry.

1.0.568
-------

* [Fix] Fixed server sending chunks before the connect chunk.

1.0.567
-------

* [Fix] Fixed app hang due to deadlocking threads.
* [Known Issue] There still is a race condition when the sender is profiling itself while the send queue is full.
* [Protocol] Added 'connect' chunk which will automatically reset the parser upon reception.

1.0.566
-------

* [Protocol] Zone chunks now use 8-bit thread indices instead of 32 bit thread ids
* [Protocol] Zone chunks now contain 8-bit cpu indices

1.0.565
-------

* Reworked zone recording, transmission and parsing.
* Application now limited to 30 FPS.

1.0.564
-------

* Parser now uses a single shared data set of completed frames. 
  Should significantly decrease synchronization time since the lock is only held when the parser encounters and "end of frame" chunk.
* Chunk queues now use a bip-buffer

1.0.563
-------

* Zones no longer get split on frame boundaries.
* [Known Issue] Zones spanning multiple frames only get displayed when their end frame is visible.

1.0.562
-------

* Double-clicking a zone now opens the source file at the zone's location in visual studio. Requires fully qualified paths enabled in the project settings.

1.0.561
-------

* Zone View: Profile bar now supports LOD.
* Zone View: Collapsed threads now draw their background instead of not drawing anything.
* Zone View: Fixed a bug where lock events would not be displayed correctly.
* Zone View: Fixed a bug where collapsing an item would not adjust the scroll position.
* Zone View: Fixed a bug where frames would not be properly aligned when double-clicked in a time line.
* Added "About" view for displaying this change log file.

1.0.560
-------

* Zone View: Lock bar now supports LOD.


1.0.559
-------

* Zone View: Large Frames will no longer be lod-merged with tiny frames.
* Zone View: Timeline now displays the frame number again (instead of frame index).
* Zone View: Summay now displayes frame numbers again (was removed in 1.0.557)
* Zone View: Zone bars now skip frames when they get too tiny. 
* Zone View: Added threshold slider "Min Frame Width" to options.

1.0.558
-------

* Increased maximum number of threads to 64.
* Fixed Array resize not zeroing "returned" memory when shrinking.

1.0.557
-------

* Zone View: Summary now supports LOD.
* Zone View: Summary now displays values in appropriate units.

1.0.556
-------

* Summary View: Added more memory details.
* Summary View: Data size is now accurate (calculated on-the-fly).
* Timeline View: Plot tree can now be collapsed.
* Timeline View: Plot tree now supports scrolling.
* Timeline View: Plot tree now has revised visuals.
* Zone View: Fixed "Time-ruler"'s tick spacing.
* Zone View: "Time-ruler" now displays frame LOD ranges when frames are below a certain pixel threshold (currently, 10 pixels).

1.0.555
-------

* Removed graph label value re-formatting for exponents below 1. (Kept Giga, Mega and Kilo, but removed milli, micro and nano).

1.0.554
-------

* Added support for counter values where the path is given by two individual strings:
  NeProfileValue( "working set/", "bytes", num_bytes )
